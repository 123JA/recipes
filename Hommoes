This is the recipe of Hommoes. Hommoes means chick peas. 
But it became the name of the puree done with chick peas. 
This puree is a starter or Appero.

First we boil the chick peas or we buy them in pots already boiled.
Then we mash them with the food processor.

In a bowl we mash some garlic with salt. We add the sesame cream and the mashed chick peas
We add lemon juice. We mix everything and it is ready!

N.B. It is tastier with a bigger ammount of lemon juice.
